"""#### Attempt to give Python a "bottom" type

* `nada` is a singleton
  * while a true bottom type has no instances
  * Python's evolving typing system seems to reject the concept
* types like `None` and `()` make for lousy bottoms
  * note that `~T|None` and `~T|()` are a poor man's Maybe Monads
    * `None` has no length and is not indexable
    *  `()` is at least iterable
    * both take few methods (much less EVERY method)
      * both must be constantly checked for
        * preventing one from blissfully go down the "happy path"
